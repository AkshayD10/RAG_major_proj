Chunking Parameters
1. chunk_size (Max size of each chunk)
What it does: Defines max tokens/characters per chunk (e.g., chunk_size=500 → max 500 tokens).

Why it matters:

Too large → Slower processing, irrelevant info.

Too small → Loses context, harder to understand.

Typical values: 300–1000 tokens; adjust based on content type.

2. chunk_overlap (Overlap between consecutive chunks)
What it does: Ensures context preservation across chunks (e.g., chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=100).

Why it matters:

Maintains sentence coherence.

Prevents key concepts from being cut off.

Typical values: 10–20% of chunk_size (e.g., chunk_size=500 → chunk_overlap=50–100).

How They Work Together
Example (chunk_size=20, chunk_overlap=5):

Chunk 1: "The quick brown fox ju"

Chunk 2: "fox jumps over the la"

Chunk 3: "the lazy dog. The dog"

Overlap ensures continuity (e.g., "fox" appears in both Chunk 1 & 2).

Impact on System
Embedding Generation:

Smaller chunks → More embeddings (higher storage).

Larger chunks → Fewer embeddings (risk of irrelevant info).

Retrieval Quality:

Balanced chunking improves search accuracy.

Performance:

Smaller chunks → Faster but storage-heavy.

Larger chunks → Slower but efficient retrieval.

Best Practices
✅ Start with chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=100.
✅ Adjust based on content (Technical: 300, Conversational: 800).
✅ Avoid splitting sentences (Use RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter).

Retrieval Parameter (k)
What k Does
Retrieves k most relevant chunks based on similarity.

More chunks improve accuracy but may slow retrieval.

How k Affects Performance
Small k (1–3):
✅ Faster, focused on most relevant info.
❌ May miss important context.

Large k (5–10):
✅ Better for complex questions, more context.
❌ Slower, risk of irrelevant chunks.

Choosing the Right k
✅ Default: k=4 or k=5.
✅ Simple Qs: k=2–3, Complex Qs: k=5–10.
✅ Test different k values to optimize retrieval.
