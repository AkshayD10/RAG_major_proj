Errors Faced and Resolutions
1. Error: chromadb.errors.InvalidDimensionException
Cause: Embedding dimension (e.g., 768) did not match the collection dimensionality (e.g., 384).

Resolution:

Deleted the existing Chroma collection using shutil.rmtree("./chroma_db").

Recreated the collection with the correct embedding model (sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2).

2. Error: no such table: collections
Cause: Chroma database schema was missing or corrupted.

Resolution:

Deleted the chroma_db directory.

Reprocessed documents to recreate the collection.

3. Error: RAG System Responded Vaguely
Cause: Prompt instructions were not specific enough to handle missing information.

Resolution:

Updated the prompt to explicitly handle cases where information is missing.

Example: "If no relevant information is available, clearly state that you don't have enough information."

4. Error: RAG System Could Not Infer Missing Information
Cause: The system defaulted to neutral responses when information was missing.

Resolution:

Modified the prompt to allow logical inferences based on available context.

Example: "If the context does not explicitly contain the information, make a logical inference."
